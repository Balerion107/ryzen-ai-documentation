##################

Quark is a comprehensive cross-platform deep learning toolkit designed to simplify and enhance the quantization of deep learning models. Supporting both PyTorch and ONNX models, Quark empowers developers to optimize their models for deployment on a wide range of hardware backends, achieving significant performance gains without compromising accuracy.

For comprehensive Quark Documentation please refer to https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/ 

From Ryzen AI 3.0, the Vitis AI Quantization deprecated. The users are strongly recommended to use Quark for the primary quantization tool.
